When grouping by a second variable, the bar chart becomes a grouped bar chart, in which multiple bars are shown for each category. An alternative would be to stack the bars on top of each other; in this case, the chart is called a stacked bar chart.","Pie Chart":"Pie Chart","Pie Chart-description":"Statistical display for categorical data. The arc length of each slice in the pie is proportional to the quantity of the respective category. An alternative display for categorical data is a bar chart.","Mosaic Plot":"Mosaic Plot","Mosaic Plot-description":"A mosaic plot can be used to visualize two or more categorical variables. The areas of the boxes in the plot are proportional to the cell frequencies of a contingency table of the selected variables.","Histogram":"Histogram","Histogram-description":"A histogram allows one to visualize the distribution of a quantitative variable. In order to create a histogram, the observed range of values is divided into different, non-overlapping intervals called \\"bins\\"; the height of each bin corresponds to how many observations are in that bin range.","Box Plot":"Box Plot","Box Plot-description":"A box and whisker plot is a representation for quantitative data. For each variable, the box plot shows its 25% quantile (a value greater than 25% of the data), its median, and its 75% quantile as a box. The whiskers extend to the lower fence at the smallest value in the sample that is less than Q1 but greater than (Q1 - 1.5*IQR) and to the analogously defined upper fence.","Line Plot":"Line Plot","Line Plot-description":"A line plot can be used to display one quantitative variable or the relationship between two quantitative variables as a number line. If no variable is supplied for the x-axis, the values of the y-axis variable are displayed according to their indices in the data table.","Map":"Map","Map-description":"Display geospatial information in a map using latitude and longitude or country / state names.","Scatterplot":"Scatterplot","Scatterplot-description":"A scatterplot is used to display the values of two quantitative variables inside a Cartesian coordinate system. Three additional variables can be displayed on the plot in this implementation: The color and type of the dots corresponding to each observation can represent categorical variables, and a quantitative variable can be chosen to govern the size of the dots. In cases where there is a textual identifier for each observation, it can be displayed as a label next to the dots. It is also possible to overlay a linear and/or smoothed regression line.","Scatterplot Matrix":"Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrix-description":"A scatterplot matrix is a grid of scatterplots visualizing the relationships between any two variables from a chosen set of quantitative variables.","Heat Map":"Heat Map","Heat Map-description":"A data display for quantitative variables in which data values are represented as colors. Regions with many observations are colored red, whereas regions without observations are colored in dark blue.","Contour Chart":"Contour Chart","Contour Chart-description":"A contour plot can be used to display the joint distribution of two quantitative variables. It plots a three-dimensional surface by plotting constant slices, called contours, on a two-dimensional grid.","QQ Plot":"QQ Plot","QQ Plot-description":"A QQ (quantile-quantile) plot allows one to compare the distribution of a sample to a reference distribution (usually a normal distribution).

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test which does not require the data to be normally distributed.","Simple Linear Regression":"Simple Linear Regression","Simple Linear Regression-description":"Statistical model which estimates a best-fit line for a response variable of interest (Y) given exactly one predictor variable (X). The line is determined by its intercept (Y-value at X = 0) and slope (the increase in Y associated with a unit increase of X).","Multiple Linear Regression":"Multiple Linear Regression","Multiple Linear Regression-description":"Predict a quantitative response variable using one or more explanatory variables.","LASSO":"LASSO","LASSO-description":"Fit a regression model in which non-zero regression coefficients are penalized using the L1 regularization penalty. The LASSO performs automatic model selection as it will shrink the regression coefficients of some variables to zero.","Decision Tree":"Decision Tree","Decision Tree-description":"Grow a decision tree for either a regression or classification problem. For quantitative responses, at each iteration of the algorithm the data are split by the variable which leads to splits with the greatest reduction in variance for the response. For categorical responses, the data are split on the feature which leads to the largest information gain (measured either in terms of the Gini index or entropy)","Random Forest":"Random Forest","Logistic Regression":"Logistic Regression","Naive Bayes":"Naive Bayes","PCA":"Principal Component Analysis","PCA-description":"Algorithm to convert observations of possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated principal components.","Hierarchical Clustering":"Hierarchical Clustering","kmeans":"kmeans","kmeans-description":"Algorithm to partition observations into k clusters by iteratively assigning them to the cluster with the nearest mean.","Mean":"Mean","Median":"Median","Min":"Min","Max":"Max","Range":"Range","Interquartile Range":"Interquartile Range","Standard Deviation":"Standard Deviation","Variance":"Variance","Correlation":"Correlation","Skewness":"Skewness","Excess Kurtosis":"Excess Kurtosis","First Quartile":"First Quartile","Third Quartile":"Third Quartile","Quantile":"Quantile","variables-invalid-alert":"The <1>quantitative</1> or <3>categorical</3> data arrays contain variable names not present in the <5>data</5> object.","addition":"Addition","subtraction":"Subtraction","multiplication":"Multiplication","division":"Division","example-description-multiply":"Multiply values of variables <1>{{first}}</1> and <3>{{second}}</3>","example-description-exponential":"Natural exponential function of variable <1>{{variable}}</1>","example-description-calculation":"Multiply values of <1>{{variable}}</1> by <3>9/5</3> and add <5>32</5>","show-example-guide":"Show Example Guide","hide-example-guide":"Hide Example Guide"}')}}]);
