  'info': '',
  'name': '',
  'variables': null
}`.
* __distributions__ | `array`: An array of strings indicating distributions that may be used in calculating probabilities. This functionality exists independently of the dataset provided. Currently limited to normal, uniform and exponential distributions. Default: `[
  'Normal',

  'Frequency Table',
  'Contingency Table'
]`.
* __tabs__ | `array`: An array of objects and keys indicating any custom tabs to add. Default: `[]`.
