Watch out for additional tutorial buttons attached to individual components inside the lesson in order to learn more about their functionality and usage.","instructor-view-handler":"The Instructor panel is the most important tool for the teacher. Here you can see exactly what your students are doing and have an overview of what\'s going on in class","language-switcher":"The language picker in the lower right allows you to set the interface to your language of choice. If the content of the lesson is available in multiple languages, you may be lucky - and see the whole thing in Chinese, for example. In any case, the interface will be displayed in your language.","statusbar-blackscreen-mode":"From time to time, it makes sense to focus entirely on the speaker\'s voice. Hence the blackout, a programmed standstill, so to speak. With it, you will not only darken your own screen, but also that of your students. One more click - and life goes on!","statusbar-dashboard-button":"The Dashboard is where ISLE stores all your movements. When you click on it, you\'ll land in your account and you\'ll be able to access your attended courses, view your progress, change your settings, and more....","statusbar-group-manager":"The group manager is a very powerful tool. If you want to assign your students to groups so that they may chat with each other or work together on text documents, you only have to enter the number of groups - and voil\xe0! Each student is randomly assigned to a group.","statusbar-info":"The status bar is your info panel. It tells you if you are logged in or not, it shows your name and profile picture (if you have uploaded one) - and it allows you to access your ISLE account in the dashboard.","statusbar-login-button":"The login should be self-explanatory. You enter your user data - and you\'re online. If you want to be on the safe side, you can activate 2-factor authentication in your ISLE dashboard.","statusbar-logout-button":"This way you can log out. Good bye ...","statusbar-presence":"By default, the circle icon will be filled green to signal that the lesson can connect to the ISLE server. Should the server be down or you be disconnected from the Internet, it will show up in dark orange instead.","statusbar-presentation-mode":"The presentation mode is intended for instructors to simplify the displayed interface when sharing their screens. When you click on it, the statusbar and other interface elements will become hidden. To restore the original view, press the function key F7 or click the eye button in the top-left.","statusbar-signup-button":"The registration process is simple. You enter your name, email address and a password - and that\'s it.","statusbar-text-chat":"The text chat allows you to communicate with other members who are online in the lesson, anonymously or with your name. If applicable, you can see the number of posts in the chat underneath the icon.","statusbar-username":"Here you should see your name displayed if logged in. If you are not logged in yet, you will be assigned a unique identifier created for you preceded by Anonymous.","statusbar-video-chat":"ISLE has a built-in conferencing tool that allows you to video chat with other users who are there at the same time. And if the hairstyle doesn\'t fit, you just turn off the camera - and the other person can still hear you.","statusbar-voice-info":"To create real-time captions or control interface elements via voice, you can use your microphone. Just click on the icon and it will turn red to indicate that it is recording. You will also see a transcription telling you what is has understood. To copy & paste the transcript, just click on the CC icon that will show to the right of it. A window with an editor will open and in it you will find your recorded text. If you want to stop the recording mode, just click on the microphone again and it will turn grey again.","sticky-note":"If you right click, you can create permanent personal sticky notes for the lesson (which will show up in green). Additionally, teachers may leave notes for all students, which will be colored orange.","toolbar-calculator":"Here you can access a calculator that allows you to make simple, but also scientific calculations.","toolbar-help":"Polls allow the instructor to take small surveys among the participants. There are four types: a yes/no question, a speed question, a like/dislike alternative, finally various survey types: free-text, multiple-choice, and number surveys.","toolbar-queue":"The queue allows the student to ask questions. They are all arranged in sequence, hence the name.","toolbar-sketchpad":"The sketchpad allows you to make notes in a graphical form. They are persistent, so they can be retrieved later. The teacher\'s notes are transmitted to all students in real-time, therefore publicly visible.","toolbar-ticketing":"Here users can create a ticket pointing out a programming error or other issue in the lesson.","toolbar-toggle":"With the following button you can open or close the toolbar. There you will find some very helpful tools..."}')}}]);
