The *Integrated Statistics Learning environment* (ISLE) is an e-learning platform for creating and delivering interactive learning content. Content is organized in lessons, which are created and modified using the *ISLE Editor*, a desktop-application for authoring and previewing ISLE lessons prior to export and online deployment.
