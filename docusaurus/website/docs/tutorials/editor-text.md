## Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a readable syntax that gets converted to HTML) is used to write most of the text in ISLE lessons. If you haven't used Markdown before, don't worry! Markdown is light-weight, and much of what you want can be typed directly into the editor with little or no additional syntax. Below is a list of a few common text formatting tools; a nice summary of basic syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and an extensive guide can also be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

**Headings**:
> `# Sample` is rendered as <span> <h1> Sample </h1> </span>
>
> `## Sample` is rendered as <span> <h2> Sample </h2> </span>
>
> `### Sample` is rendered as <span> <h3> Sample </h3> </span>
  
**Emphasis**:
> `*sample*` is rendered as *sample*
>
> `**sample**` is rendered as **sample**

**Links**:

> `[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)` renders as [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) (and you can click to follow the link)

**Lists**:

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. An unordered list is made with asterisks (`*`) and hyphens (`-`) for the bullet points. For example,

    * Item 1
    * Item 2
        - sub-item

renders as

* Item 1
* Item 2
    - sub-item
    
For an ordered list, we use numbers:

    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
    3. Item 3
    
becomes

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

<br/>

**Tables**:

To make tables in Markdown, vertical bars (`|`) are used to define columns and three or more hyphens (`---`) specify the column headings. For example,

    | Book | Author |
    | --- | --- |
    | Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire | J.K. Rowling |
    | 1984 | George Orwell |
    | Americanah | Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie |
    
is rendered similar to

| Book | Author |
| --- | --- |
| Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire | J.K. Rowling |
| 1984 | George Orwell |
| Americanah | Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie |

## LaTeX

LaTeX equations can be included by using the special `TeX` tag. Full details of the tag options can be found in the [docs](https://isledocs.com/docs/tex); the options you will use most are
* **raw**: the LaTeX code to render.
* **displayMode**: inline (false) or display mode (true). Defaults to false.
* **numbered**: whether to display an equation number of display mode equations. Defaults to false.

For example, `<TeX raw="\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2}"  displayMode={true} />` is rendered as

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2}" />

Alternatively, inline LaTeX can be written with `$ $` and display-mode LaTeX equations can also be written with `$$ $$` or `\[ \]` rather than the `TeX` tag. For example, the same equation as above can be created by

    \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2}\]

and

    $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2}$$

## HTML

In addition to custom ISLE tags like `TeX`, standard HTML tags are supported by ISLE. For example,

```
    <ul> 
        <li> visualization </li>
        <li> data analysis </li>
        <li> statistical modeling </li>
    </ul>
```

is rendered as

<ul> 
    <li> visualization </li>
    <li> data analysis </li>
    <li> statistical modeling </li>
</ul>

A comprehensive cheat sheet on HTML tags can be found [here](https://digital.com/tools/html-cheatsheet/).
