## Managing Cohorts and Student Enrollment

In the [Setting Up](https://isledocs.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started) tutorial, we covered how to create cohorts for student enrollment. As a reminder, to see the existing cohorts, click **Edit course** in the dashboard bar - the current cohorts will be displayed on the right. You can create additional cohorts with the **Create Cohort** button. To see the students enrolled in a cohort and edit the cohort information (name, email filter, etc.) click the **Edit** button. You can then remove a student from the course by click the **x** next to their email address, and confirming the action by clicking **Save**.

As an additional note, the option to prevent students from enrolling is useful for creating "scratch work" courses that allow you to post lessons and experiment with ISLE without the material available to students.

## Announcements

ISLE also provides the ability to make announcements to students in your class. To create a new announcement, click the **Course Data** button in the dashboard bar, then enter a title and message under **New Announcement**. When you are ready to post, click **Create**.

Posted announcements will appear on the left, where you can edit and delete them. Students will see course announcements under **Messages** on their course profile page:

## Student Progress

As students submit answers to questions, a progress bar tracks the proportion of the lesson that they have completed. Students can see their progress at the top of the lesson, under their course profile, or on the course dashboard:

As an instructor, you can track student progress in the **Progress** tab of the **Course Data** section:

By default, the **Progress** tab will show the progress of all students. If you wish to find a specific student, you can filter by their name, email, or cohort.

## Course Files

The **Files** tab of the **Course Data** section allows you to see all files that have been uploaded by the instructor, or submitted by students.

![Files](assets/images/course_files.png)

When students submit a file, such as a project report, HTML and PDF versions will appear in the course files. These can be viewed with the **Open** button next to the file name. To see only the files for a specific student or lesson, you can filter by student name or lesson name. Instructors may also find it useful to post files to ISLE, for example to upload data for a lesson. To upload a file as an instructor, use the **Upload file** button.
