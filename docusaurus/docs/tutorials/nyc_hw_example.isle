## Homework: NYC Housing Data

In this homework, weâ€™ll use a random sample of 4000 households from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, a well-designed survey done every three years to characterize NYC housing conditions. Information is collected on both demographics  and housing quality.

Please take a look at the description of the data set and its variables to familiarize yourself with the type of information we have for each household. Note that for education, the labels are unknown but higher values indicate more education; higher self-reported health status values correspond to better overall health.

        questions={<Text raw={`
        1. In your own words, describe the New York City housing data set (what a row in the data represents, how many observations and variables, the source of the data, a summary of the information the variables contain, and any potential data issues).

        2. Using just the data description and variable descriptions, come up with a research question that you can answer using the NYC housing data. What is your motivation for investigating this question? What is your initial hypothesis?

        3. For your research question in 2., explain how you would answer this question with the data. What variables would you use? What statistics would you calculate? What figures/tables would you make? How would you use those statistics/figures/tables to draw a conclusion about your research question? *(Don't perform the analysis here, just describe what you would do).*

        4. Carry out the analysis you described in 3. and report your results. Include any statistics you calculate and any figures/tables you make.

        5. What do you conclude about your research question from (b)? Do you have any evidence for/against your initial hypothesis?
