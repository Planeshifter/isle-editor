/**
* A basic bootstrap table.
*
* @property {boolean} bordered - adds borders on all sides of the table and cells
* @property {boolean} borderless - removes all borders on the table and cells, including table header
* @property {boolean} hover - enable a hover state on table rows within a <tbody>
* @property {(boolean|string)} responsive - responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Across every breakpoint, use responsive for horizontally scrolling tables. Responsive tables are wrapped automatically in a div. Use responsive="sm", responsive="md", responsive="lg", or responsive="xl" as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally
* @property {string} size - make tables more compact by cutting cell padding in half by setting size as `sm`
* @property {boolean} striped - adds zebra-striping to any table row within the <tbody>
* @property {string} variant - invert the colors of the table â€” with light text on dark backgrounds by setting variant as dark
